<td valign="top" align="justify"><font size="4"><p>Hawaii is known for its beautiful beachesâ€”some of them with unusual colors. Many beaches are filled with white sand, but other Hawaiian shores are covered with green, red, pink, and even black sand. Whether you like hiking, biking, kayaking, sailing, swimming, or just sitting on the beach, Hawaii is the state for you. The islands of The Bahamas are a tropical hot spot and rank among the best vacation destinations in the world. Their beauty, amazing weather, and the fact that there are so many islands (700 in total) are part of what makes this tropical archipelago special. 
  Mauritius offers a wealth of natural beauty and exciting activities for every traveller. Visit the island's several unique natural features, including the 7-Coloured Earths of Chamarel, the Black River Gorges and two UNESCO World Heritage status monuments.&nbsp;</p>
